#summary Working Practices

= The Branch-When-Needed system =

From: http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/doc/user/svn-best-practices.html

(This is the system used by the Subversion project.)

Users commit their day-to-day work on /trunk.

Rule #1: /trunk must compile and pass regression tests at all times.

Rule #2: a single commit (changeset) must not be so large so as to discourage peer-review.

Rule #3: if rules #1 and #2 come into conflict (i.e. when it's impossible to make a series of small commits without disrupting the trunk), then the user should create a branch and commit a series of smaller changesets there. This allows peer-review without disrupting the stability of /trunk.

Pros: /trunk is guaranteed to be stable at all times. The hassle of branching/merging is somewhat rare.

Cons: Adds a bit of burden to users' daily work: they must compile and test before every commit.
